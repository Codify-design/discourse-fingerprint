        <p>
        A flagged fingerprint is a fingerprint that was hidden or silenced.
        A <i>hidden fingerprint</i> will not be shown in the <i>Latest matches</i> section.
        A <i>silenced fingerprint</i> will cause all users with the given fingerprint to be silenced next time they are fingerprinted.
        </p>

        <p>
        Silencing a fingerprint should be used only as a last resort because it is not guaranteed that it always matches the same user.
        For example, users with similar configuration and hardware (i.e. same phone) have a high chance of matching.
