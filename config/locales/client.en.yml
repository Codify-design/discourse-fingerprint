        <p>
        A <i>hidden fingerprint</i> will not be shown in the <i>Latest Matched Fingerprints</i> section.
        A <i>silenced fingerprint</i> will cause all users with the given fingerprint to be silenced next time they visit.
        </p>

        <p>
        Silencing a fingerprint should be used only as a last resort as it is not guaranteed that it always matches the same user.
        For example, users with similar configuration and hardware (devices of same make and model) have a high chance of having matching fingerprints.
